This is a r-python3.6 S2I image that utilizes plumber for a web service. 
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample MODEL invocation (note the use of incremental so the second time you build packrat deps should not need to be downloaded):

s2i build --copy . mitre/r-python3.6 mitre/mlaas-r-python:v1

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 sample-app
