# ECPaaS Demonstration

This directory includes three different example projects, each with their own instructions:

- [cdc-mlaas-python](./cdc-mlaas-python): A Python based web application that provides MLaaS
- [cdc-mlaas-r](./cdc-mlaas-r): An R based web application, which also utilizes Python, that provides MLaaS
- [s2i-r-python3](./s2i-r-python3): A source-to-image (S2I) template that builds a docker image which includes R and Python 3

To use the S2I instructions for [cdc-mlaas-r](./cdc-mlaas-r), [s2i-r-python3](./s2i-r-python3) instructions must be followed first.
